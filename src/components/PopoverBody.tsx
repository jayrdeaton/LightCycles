  // (unused for 'center', see caretOffset below) so the caret can be pinned to the trigger's actual
  // center via a fixed offset from the edge the content is flush with, rather than the content
  // box's own midpoint. Content is usually much wider than its trigger and grows away from it for
  // 'left'/'right', so those two midpoints only coincide by coincidence, if at all.

// inherits any rotation transform the trigger's zone applies — a Portal-based popover renders at
// the app root, outside that transform, and would end up upside-down relative to its own trigger
// once the lobby's face-to-face zone gets flipped. Positioned via percentage (`top:'100%'`) against
// the trigger's own wrapper rather than a measured pixel rect, so no onLayout/measurement plumbing
// is needed and it resolves correctly regardless of how deep the trigger sits in the tree.

  // regardless of either one's width, so the content box's own 50% already coincides with the
  // trigger's center. For 'left'/'right', content is flush with one edge of the (typically much
