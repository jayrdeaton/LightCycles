// Opt-in "Lock Orientation" preference (see SettingsDialog) for anyone who'd rather pin the
// current layout than have it follow every tilt — off by default, so the app freely rotates with
// the device and useDeviceOrientation just tracks whatever that live shape currently is. When
// enabled, pins native rotation to whichever orientation is active at that moment; disabling it
// unlocks rather than restoring one specific orientation, so free rotation resumes immediately
// rather than snapping back to whatever was last locked. On web this rejects (NotSupportedError)
// whenever the page isn't in fullscreen — the catch keeps that expected, unsupported-environment
// rejection from surfacing as an unhandled promise rejection.
