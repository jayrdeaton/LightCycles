// Base identity fields (name/color/tag) are shared with every other @tastic game declaring the same
// App Group entitlement (see SHARED_GROUP_ID and @tastic/profile's own loadSharedProfiles/
// saveSharedProfiles) — create a profile in BoxHockey, it shows up here too, and vice versa.
// keyScheme is LightCycles-specific (BoxHockey's analogous field is controlScheme) and deliberately
// does NOT travel through that shared store — it's kept entirely in this app's own local
// `extensions` table (see LocalProfilesState in profilesValidation.ts), keyed by profile id, and
// merged onto the shared base roster in the `profiles` getter below, falling back to
// DEFAULT_KEY_SCHEME the first time a profile created on another app shows up here.
// isSharedProfileStoreAvailable is false on Android/web and on any iOS build that hasn't run
// `expo prebuild` since the entitlement was added — `local.localBase` (only ever read/written in
// that case) keeps this screen fully usable there too, just without cross-app sharing.
